# Text Analysis of Buddenbrook novel (Thomas Mann)

Buddenbrooks is a 1901 novel by Thomas Mann, chronicling the decline of a wealthy north German merchant family over the course of four generations, incidentally portraying the manner of life and mores of the Hanseatic bourgeoisie in the years from 1835 to 1877. (Source: Wikipedia)

This folder consists of two KNIME workflows:
* The *sentiment* workflow performs a sentiment analysis of the whole novel and shows that it can reproduce the decline of the family by systematic text processing.
* The *person* workflow analyzes the mentions of persons wrt. a specific part of the novel.

Both workflows were designed under KNIME version 2.11.x and use the text processing as well as the R plugin for KNIME.
